Protech API

### Requirements
- Keycloak 25.0.2
- Java 17
- Postgres or MySQL???
- Ngrok

    
### About
- this project is just for fun only, I will develop a subscription based software. Maybe this project will be something like a membership program that will allow the user to pay the subscription fee in order to become a member of something.
- I was planning that maybe I can just open this publicly so that College Students or Freenlancers can freely clone this shit and so they can make their lives easier.

### Note
- The requirements of this project aren't fully established yet, so yea, maybe from time to time, I'll slowly finish this project.
